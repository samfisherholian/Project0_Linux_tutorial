        <p>
            A Linux distribution is a collection of (usually open source) software on top of a Linux
            kernel. A distribution (or short, distro) can bundle server software, system management
            tools, documentation and many desktop applications in a central secure software
            repository. A distro aims to provide a common look and feel, secure and easy software
            management and often a specific operational purpose.

        <h1>Red Hat.</h1>

        <p>
            Red Hat is a billion dollar commercial Linux company that puts a lot of effort in developing
            Linux. They have hundreds of Linux specialists and are known for their excellent support.
            They give their products (Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora) away for free. While Red
            Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is well tested before release and supported for up to seven
            years after release, Fedora is a distro with faster updates but without support.
        </p>

        <h1>Ubuntu.</h1>

        <p>
            Canonical started sending out free compact discs with Ubuntu Linux in 2004 and quickly
            became popular for home users (many switching from Microsoft Windows). Canonical
            wants Ubuntu to be an easy to use graphical Linux desktop without need to ever see a
            command line. Of course they also want to make a profit by selling support for Ubuntu.
        </p>

        <h1>Debian.</h1>

        <p>
            There is no company behind Debian. Instead there are thousands of well organised
            developers that elect a Debian Project Leader every two years. Debian is seen as one of
            the most stable Linux distributions. It is also the basis of every release of Ubuntu. Debian
            comes in three versions: stable, testing and unstable. Every Debian release is named after
            a character in the movie Toy Story.
