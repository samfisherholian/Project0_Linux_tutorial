            <p id="paragraphs">
                All modern operating systems have their roots in 1969 when Dennis Ritchie and Ken
                Thompson developed the C language and the Unix operating system at AT&T Bell Labs.
                They shared their source code (yes, there was open source back in the Seventies) with the
                rest of the world, including the hippies in Berkeley California. By 1975, when AT&T started
                selling Unix commercially, about half of the source code was written by others. The hippies
                were not happy that a commercial company sold software that they had written; the resulting
                (legal) battle ended in there being two versions of Unix: the official AT&T Unix, and the
                free BSD Unix.

                In the Eighties many companies started developing their own Unix: IBM created AIX, Sun
                SunOS (later Solaris), HP HP-UX and about a dozen other companies did the same. The
                result was a mess of Unix dialects and a dozen different ways to do the same thing. And
                here is the first real root of Linux, when Richard Stallman aimed to end this era of Unix
                separation and everybody re-inventing the wheel by starting the GNU project (GNU is Not
                Unix). His goal was to make an operating system that was freely available to everyone, and
                where everyone could work together (like in the Seventies). Many of the command line tools
                that you use today on Linux are GNU tools.

              The Nineties started with Linus Torvalds, a Swedish speaking Finnish student, buying a
              386 computer and writing a brand new POSIX compliant kernel. He put the source code
              online, thinking it would never support anything but 386 hardware. Many people embraced
              the combination of this kernel with the GNU tools, and the rest, as they say, is history.
